# How Much Do You Burn
#Overview
This Jupyter notebook project predicts the number of calories burned based on various physical and physiological parameters using machine learning techniques in Python.

# Notebook
The main component of this project is the Jupyter notebook Calories_Burn_Prediction.ipynb, which contains:
Data exploration and visualization
Data preprocessing steps
Model training and evaluation
Prediction using the trained model
#Dataset
https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/fmendes/fmendesdat263xdemos
#Requirements
Python (>=3.6)
Jupyter Notebook
#Steps in the Notebook
Import Libraries: Import the necessary libraries for data manipulation, visualization, and machine learning.

Load the Dataset: Load the dataset into a pandas DataFrame.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):

Display the first few rows of the dataset
Show summary statistics
Check for missing values
Visualize relationships between features using pair plots
Data Preprocessing:

Separate features and the target variable
Define numerical and categorical features
Create a preprocessing pipeline to handle scaling and encoding
Train-Test Split: Split the dataset into training and testing sets.

Model Training and Evaluation:

Define different machine learning models
Train and evaluate models using Mean Squared Error (MSE), Mean Absolute Error (MAE), and R-squared (R2)
Perform cross-validation to assess the generalization ability of the models
